# p28-3x7

Build information around the Boldport Club project 28 - 3x7 -- a fancy 3 digit 7 segment display

## Bits & pieces

## Placing the MOSFETs

I'm starting by placing the MOSFETs on the board as spacers for two board pieces in the suggested distance of around 10mm. One of the LEDs makes for a great MOSFET spacer. Those are soldered in place at one leg from this side.

## Finalising the MOSFETs

After tacking them on, I turned the board, clipped the legs close to the PCB and added nice blobs.

## Sticking the LEDs

Next up are the LEDs which I simply placed in the board, ensuring correct orientation.

## Holding the LEDs

Then I aligned and fixated the second PCB to the first PCB  using some copper wire in the 4 corner holes and turned it around. This allows me to properly adjust the LEDs to the mask without worrying about movement.

## Soldering LEDs

I started by clipping and soldering just the longer legs of the LEDs, reassuring correct orientation.

Then I corrected misaligned LEDs, clipped the other legs and blobbed those, too.

Then I removed the copper wire from the corners and turned it around, again rechecking proper placement.

## Placing the resistors

Then I started to place the resistors around the PCB filling every second hole as well as the 4 sitting flat on the board.

Unfortunately no more intermediate images from here on, lost them somehow...

## Fudging in the top PCB

Now comes a bit of fiddly part with sorting the resistors into the top place. Those have to be bent around and fed back to the main PCB. I used strong pulling with my tweezers to straigten the legs and create a nice stichting look. The resistors were then centered for a tidy look. Then the stitches were laid flat on the desk and, the legs trimmed and blobbed nicely to the board.

## Reblobbing the PCB

After careful reblobbing and cleaning the project is done and can be hooked up to a power source (negative to any of the two ground pins and positive goes to both one of the three LED sectors as well as the to be lit up segment selectors.
